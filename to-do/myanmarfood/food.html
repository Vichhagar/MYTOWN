              <p>Laphet, a Myanmar traditional fermented tea leaf, has been developed as an ethnic food. It has a very long history in Myanmar. In ancient times fermented tea leaves were used as a peace symbol or peace offering between warring kingdoms. </p>

              <h2>Myanmar Street Foods</h2>
              <p>One of the best ways to get a taste (literally) of a city is through exploring its food sold on the street, where stores specialise in 1–2 dishes and strive to make the best of them. While it’s often arguable if street food nowadays is really the go-to food amongst locals — for instance pasar malams in Singapore or the night markets in Bangkok — you can be sure that the street food scene in Yangon is as local as it gets.</p>

              <h2>Myanmar Dessert</h2>
              <p>Falooda, the most popular dessert in Myanmar?</p>
            </div>
            <p>Falooda is a very popular summer drink because it’s cold and sweet. Originally it came from Persia, but it is popular from India to Southeast Asia. Each country has its own version. It’s a mixture of rose syrup, vermicelli or agar agar jelly, basil seeds, sago or tapioca pearls (white or coloured), ice-cream, milk or water and like in this bakery… pudding. Oh, and ice to make it refreshing in the Myanmar heat.</p>
            <p>In bakeries all over Yangon you always see locals having falooda after dinner. It’s also a very popular drink for kids because when they prepare it at home they get to add all the coloured ingredients. You can also drink falooda in the streets of Myanmar. Street falooda is usually cheaper and less sophisticated. </p>
